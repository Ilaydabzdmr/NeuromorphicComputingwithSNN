# NeuromorphicComputingwithSNN
In this project, I used an ultrasonic distance sensor, a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulated using Brian2, and a Raspberry Pi communicating with an Arduino. Depending on how fast an object approaches, the robot either responds warmly or warns intruders to stay away.
